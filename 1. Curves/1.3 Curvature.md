### *Is a curve that doesn't curve a curve?*

More or less we have intuition on what a curvature is. A linear, flat section should have zero curvature while the "steeper" the curvature the greater it must be so we expect the definition to match the higher-level, hand-wavy idea.

Note that we are implicitly talking about **regular** curves, so we always have a non-zero derivative and thus we aren't forced to deal with "spikes".


## Arc Length Parametarization

For arc length parametarization, curvature is defined simply as the **magnitude of its second derivative** $\kappa = \left | \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2} \right |$.
As seen in the last section, when dealing with natural parametarization we have proven that this implies

$$\left <\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s}, \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2} \right> = 0$$
Since the symbolism can get a bit hairy, we define the **tangent vector** 

$$\textbf{T}(\sigma) = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s}(\sigma)$$ and the **normal vector** 

$$\textbf{N}(\sigma) = \frac{\frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2}}{\left | \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2} \right |}(\sigma) = \frac{T'}{\left | T' \right|}(\sigma)$$

So we have a clear connection between the second derivative, the normal vector and curvature

$$\textbf{T}' = \kappa \textbf{N}$$
As we've seen the normal vector will be orthogonal to the tangent vector. 

### Example: 

Given the unit-length parametarization of the circle

$\boldsymbol{\gamma}(s) = (\text{Cos}(s),\ \text{Sin}(s))$

Then we can easily calculate

$$\textbf{T}(s) = (-\text{Sin}(s),\ \text{Cos}(s))$$
$$\textbf{T'}(s) = (-\text{Cos}(s),\ -\text{Sin}(s)) = - \boldsymbol{\gamma}(s)$$

so the curvature is **constant** across the curve which we should have expected.

## General Parametarization

We notice that the definition of curvature we gave above requires the parametarization of the curve which as we saw, is not always possible to derive so we'll need to see how to derive it from the *general* parametarization of a curve.

Let $\boldsymbol{\gamma}(t)$ be a curve of not necessarily arc-length parametarization. We can assume the arc-length parametarization $s(t)$.

Now we symbolize the derivative as
$$\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s} \frac{\partial{s}}{\partial t}$$
Our goal is to start from the curvature definition of the normal parametarization and express it in terms of the general parametarization.
$$\kappa = \left | \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2} \right| = \left | \frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma/}\partial t}{\partial s / \partial t})}{\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}} \right | = \left | \frac{\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}\frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial t^2} - \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial t}\frac{\partial^2 s}{\partial t^2}}{(\frac{\partial s}{\partial t})^3}  \right |$$

We will no try to replace all the terms of natural parametarization noticing that

$$\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} = \left |\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial t} \right |$$

$$\left (\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}\right )^2= \left |\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial t} \right |^2 = \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\cdot\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$$
$$ \frac{\partial s}{\partial t}\frac{\partial^2 s}{\partial t^2} = \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \cdot \ddot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$$

So putting everything together we finally get

$$\frac{\left | (\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})\ddot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} - (\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\cdot\ddot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\right|}{\left| \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \right|^4} = \frac{\left | \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \times (\ddot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \times \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})  \right|}{\left| \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \right|^4} $$

because $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$ and $\ddot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \times \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$ are perpendicular we finally get

$$\kappa = \frac{|\ddot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\times \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}|}{|\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}|^3}$$

Note that this is applicable to $\mathbb{R}^3$. For $\mathbb{R}^2$ we can just project on the XY plane and easily derive the equivalent definition on the plane

$$\kappa = \frac{det({\ddot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}})}{|\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}|^3}$$
### Example

Now we can investigate the curvature of more exotic curves like the quadrifolium which is parametarized as

$$r(t) = \left (2\ \text{Sin}^2(t)\text{Cos}(t),\ 2\ \text{Cos}^2(t)\text{Sin}(t) \right)$$

```mathematica
rs[t_] := {2 Sin[t]^2 Cos[t], 2 Cos[t]^2 Sin[t]}
ParametricPlot[rs[t], {t, 0 , 2 Pi}]
```

![[quadrifolium.png]]

Now to calculate the curvature we just apply the definition of curvature for the general parametarization we derived.


```mathematica
curv[t_] := Det[{rs''[t], rs'[t]}]/Norm[rs'[t]]^3
ParametricPlot[{t, curv[t]}, {t, 0, 2 Pi}]
```
![[quadrifolium_curvature.png]]

As we see, the curvature is bigger where the curve itself is steeper at $κπ/2 + π/4$ but near the center at $κπ/2$ it reaches zero as it locally approximates a curve.

To prove this further, we can try varying the *color* of the curve according to the curvature. Note that to achieve this we need to **rescale** the values of `curv` to be between $0$ and $1$.
```mathematica
ParametricPlot[{rs[t][[1]], rs[t][[2]]}, {t, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, 
 ColorFunctionScaling -> False, 
 ColorFunction -> 
  Function[{x, y, u}, 
   ColorData["Rainbow"][Rescale[curv[u], {curv[0], curv[Pi/4]}, {0, 1}]]]]
```

## Osculating circles 
The curvature is also often defined as a means of an **osculating circle**. An osculating circle is one that best approximates a curve. This means that its first and second derivatives are equal to the curve's derivatives.

The *radius* $\kappa$ of this circle curve is then inversely proportional to the *curvature*

$$R = \frac{1}{\kappa}$$
We'll plot the example of the 8-petalled rose curve

```mathematica
rs[t_] := {Cos[4 t] Cos[t], Cos[4 t] Sin[t]}
ParametricPlot[rs[t], {t, 0, 2 Pi}]
```

![[rose.png]]

We'll use the same function as previously for the curvature. Now on to the plotting of the curvature

```mathematica
ParametricPlot[{t, curv[t]}, {t, 0, 2 Pi}]
```

![[rose_curvature.png]]

We saw that the oscullating circle must be of radius $\frac{1}{\kappa}$ and has to be tangent at a specific point, then we can define the center of the osculating center at point $t_0$ to be $\boldsymbol{\gamma}(t_0) + \kappa\textbf{N}(t_0)$.

We can calculate the normal vector $\textbf{N}$:

```mathematica
normal[t_] := Normalize[rs'[t]] . {{0, 1}, {-1, 0}}
```

So finally putting it all together we have

```mathematica
frame[t0_] := Show[
  ParametricPlot[rs[t], {t, 0, t0}],
  ParametricPlot[
   rs[t0] + curv[t0] * normal[t0] + curv[t0] * {Cos[t], Sin[t]}, {t, 
    0, 2 Pi}, PlotStyle -> {Orange, Dashed}], 
  PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}}
  ]
```

## Curvature and angle rate of change

Another way to define the curvature is as the rate of change of the angle. Now the question is which angle?

Conventionally, the angle is defined in temrs of the tangent vector

$$\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}(s_0) = (Cos(\theta_0), Sin(\theta_0))$$

![[angle_curve.png]]


Since the curvature is defined as $\kappa = \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial s}$, then integrating the curvature over an interval $\{t_0, t_n\}$ gives us the change of angle:

$$\int_{t_0}^{t_n}\kappa(\tau)d \tau = \Delta\theta_n - \Delta\theta_0$$

### *What about Serret?*

## Binormal vector

We have seen that for a specific point $t_0$ we can define the normal vector $\boldsymbol{N}(t_0)$ and the tangent vector $\boldsymbol{T}(t_0)$ that are *unit* vectors that are *orthogonal* to each other.

We can now define the **binormal** vector $\boldsymbol{B}(t_0)$ as

$$\boldsymbol{B} = \boldsymbol{T}\times\boldsymbol{N}$$
which is by the definition of the cross product orthogonal to both $\boldsymbol N$ and $\boldsymbol T$ so $\left \{\boldsymbol T, \boldsymbol N, \boldsymbol B \right \}$  

## Frenet Frame

As mentioned before, the three unit vectors $\left \{\boldsymbol T, \boldsymbol N, \boldsymbol B \right \}$ constitute an **orthonormal basis**. More specifically, it is considered a **moving orthonormal frame**. We'll se later how the Frenet Frame uniquely defines a curve up to a **Euclidean transformation**, but for now we'll just present some examples to better aid our intuition.

Consider the following curve:

```mathematica
r[t_] := {Cos[t]^3, Sin[t]^3, Sqrt[3] Sin[2 t]/2}
ParametricPlot3D[r[t], {t, 0, 2 Pi}]
```

Now we will plot the three orthonomrmal vectors  as described above along the curve 

```mathematica
frame[t0_] := 
 Show[ParametricPlot3D[r[t], {t, 0, t0}, 
   PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}, {-2, 2}}],
  Graphics3D[{Arrowheads[0.03], {
     ColorData[98, 1], Arrow[{r[t0], r[t0] + Normalize[r'[t0]]}], 
     ColorData[98, 2], 
     Arrow[{r[t0], 
       r[t0] + Normalize[Cross[Cross[r'[t0], r''[t0]], r'[t0]]]}],
     ColorData[98, 3], 
     Arrow[{r[t0], r[t0] + Normalize[Cross[r'[t0], r''[t0]]]}]
     }
    }]]
```

We can see the frame twisting and turning along the curve. Later, we will look into how the *rate of change* of those vectors tie back to the notions of **curvature** and **torsion**

A very important result of the frame is that it completely characterizes the curve up to a Euclidean transformation. To be more specific we will introduce the following definition:

> Two curves $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are  **congruent** if $\exists\ Q_1, c\ \gamma_1 = Q_1 \gamma_2 + c$ where $Q_1$ is a rotation matrix and  $c$ a vector.

More intuitively, two curves are congruent if we can derive one from the other just by rotating it and moving it around (we are not allow to "stretch" or "twist" it).

Under translation, the Frenet Frame remains invariant (remember that despite the above visualization, the Frenet Frame consists from unit vectors defined at the origin). Under rotation $Q_1$ the Frenet Frame of the rotated curve is also transformed under $Q_1$.

We'll hold on this idea for the end of the next section.

## Frame Derivatives 

We will now start by taking the derivatives of the orthonormal basis vectors, the so-called **Frenet-Serret formulas** which are described as follows (note again the unit-length parametarization):

$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol T}{\partial s} = \kappa \boldsymbol N$$

$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol N}{\partial s} = -\kappa \boldsymbol T + \tau \boldsymbol B$$

$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol B}{\partial s} =  - \tau \boldsymbol N$$


$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol T' \\
\boldsymbol N' \\
\boldsymbol B' \\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}   
	0& \kappa  & 0\\   
	-\kappa & 0 & \tau\\
	0 & -\tau & 0\\   
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol T \\
\boldsymbol N \\
\boldsymbol B \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$\kappa$ is again the curvature (keep in mind that  $\kappa = \left | \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2} \right |$) and $\tau$ is defined as the **torsion** of the curve, $\tau = -\frac{\partial \boldsymbol B}{\partial s} \boldsymbol N$ .

## Torsion

We will try to derive a formula for torsion. We start with considering the derivatives for the **arc-length** parametarization

$$\tau = - \boldsymbol{N} \cdot({T \times N })' =  - \boldsymbol{N} \cdot({T' \times N }) - \boldsymbol{N} \cdot({T \times N' })$$
but since $\boldsymbol{T' \times N }$ and $\boldsymbol{N}$ are perpendicular we end up with 

$$\tau = - \boldsymbol{N} \cdot({T \times N' }) = \frac{1}{\kappa}\frac{\partial^2 \gamma}{\partial t ^2} \cdot(\frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial t } \times (\frac{1}{\kappa}\frac{\partial^3 \gamma}{\partial t ^3} + \frac{\frac{\partial \kappa}{\partial t}}{\kappa^2}\frac{\partial^2 \gamma}{\partial t ^2} )) = \frac{1}{\kappa}\ddot{\gamma} \cdot(\dot{\gamma} \times (\frac{1}{\kappa}\dddot{\gamma} + \frac{\dot{\kappa}}{\kappa^2}\ddot{ \gamma} ))$$

but $\ddot{\gamma}$ is perpendicuar to $\dot{\gamma} \times \dddot{\gamma}$ so we finally end up with 

$$\tau = \frac{1}{\kappa^2}\dddot{\gamma} \cdot(\dot{\gamma} \times \ddot{ \gamma} )$$

Before moving forward with the intuition, let's calculate the torsion of our curve:

```mathematica
tors[t_] := 
 Dot[Cross[r'[t], r''[t]], r'''[t]]/Norm[Cross[r'[t], r''[t]]]^2
ParametricPlot[{t, tors[t]}, {t, 0, 2 Pi}]
```

![[tennis_torsion.png]]

Visualizing it in the curve
```mathematica
ParametricPlot3D[{r[t][[1]], r[t][[2]], r[t][[3]]}, {t, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, 
 ColorFunctionScaling -> False, 
 ColorFunction -> 
  Function[{x, y, u}, 
   ColorData["Rainbow"][
    Rescale[tors[u], {tors[0], tors[Pi/2]}, {0, 1}]]]]
```

Going back to the Frenet formulas, what torsion gives us is essentially how fast the binormal rotates so it makes sense to be minimal in points where it's mostly "flat" as we'll see.

Also going back to the fact that the Frenet Frame is invariable under Euclidean transformations, we can prove the fact that the curvature together with the torsion uniquely identifies a curve. For example all curves with constant torsion $\tau_0$ and curvature $\kappa_0$ represent the *same* helix that is possibly rotated and moved around.

## Flat Curves

A **flat** curve is one that lies completely on a plane of the 3D space. This means that a curve is flat iff its binormal vector is constant and thus has a zero torsion (since its rate of change will be zero).

Let's verify this with an ellipse

```mathematica
r[t_] := RotationMatrix[20, {1, 0, 1}] . {3 Cos[t], Sin[t], 0}
frame[t0_] := 
 Show[ParametricPlot3D[r[t], {t, 0, 2 Pi}, 
   PlotRange -> {{-3, 3}, {-3, 3}, {-3, 3}}], 
  Graphics3D[{Arrowheads[0.03], {ColorData[98, 1], 
     Arrow[{r[t0], r[t0] + Normalize[r'[t0]]}], ColorData[98, 2], 
     Arrow[{r[t0], 
       r[t0] + Normalize[Cross[Cross[r'[t0], r''[t0]], r'[t0]]]}], 
     ColorData[98, 3], 
     Arrow[{r[t0], r[t0] + Normalize[Cross[r'[t0], r''[t0]]]}]}}]]
frames = Table[frame[t], {t, 0.01, 2 Pi, (2 Pi)/100}][[;; -2]];

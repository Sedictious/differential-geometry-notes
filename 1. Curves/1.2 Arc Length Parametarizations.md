### *Slow and Steady*

One would be right to ask whether there are certain other properties of the parametarization that make certain parametarizations more desirable. Turns out there is a very important parametarization, so much so that it is called **natural** parametarization.

## Unit-speed parametarization

One of the most common uses of curves is to describe a trajectory of a moving particle where $\boldsymbol{\gamma}(t)$ represents the position of the body at time $t$. It should be known from elementary physics that the rate of change of a moving body with respect to time $\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s}$ represents the velocity/speed of the particle at a specific time. Similarly, the rate of change of the speed $\frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2}$ represents the *acceleration* vector.

The velocity vector of a unit-speed parametarization is **always** perpendicular to the curve since for such a parametarization we can see that

$$  \frac{\partial}{\partial s}{\left | \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s} \right |^2} = 0\implies \left <\frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2}, \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s} \right> + \left <\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s}, \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2} \right> = 0 \implies \left <\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s}, \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s^2} \right> = 0$$

## Natural Parametarization

A parametarization of a curve $\boldsymbol{\gamma}(s)$ is called **natural** if it's derivative $|\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\gamma}}{\partial s}| = 1$. This is also called **unit speed parametarization** and the remarkable thing is that such a parametarization *always* exists (you can create a constructive proof and you can get a small taste of it later).

Before proceeding further to the mathematical details, let's thing about what would be some common applications of such a parametarization. One common application would be in graphics where transition between two keyframes of a skeleton is oftentimes expressed with curves that are meant to fill in the motion between the defined frames. We want the motion to be more or less uniform so it's not enough to simply define the curve but also give a parametarization of constant speed.

To illustrate a relatively extreme example, consider the conchospiral which is parametarized by $\boldsymbol{\gamma}(t) = (t \text{Cos}(2^t),\ t \text{Sin}(2^t),\ 2^{t-1})$. You could easily guess from the exponent that the curve won't be of normal speed but we could also quickly illustrate this with Mathematica

```mathematica
frame[t0_] := 
  Show[ParametricPlot3D[{t Cos[2^t], t Sin[2^t], 2^(t - 1)}, {t, 0, 
     t0}, PlotRange -> {{-6.5, 6.5}, {-6.5, 6.5}, {0, 40}}]];
```

Could we represent the same exact same curve but with a natural parametarization? We start by thinking that we want to get express the curve in terms of a parameter $s$ that indicates how *far* we've travelled in the curve. If s is proportional to the curve length, then we need to be travelling with constant speed.

This gives us the desired natural parametarization:

$$s(t) = \int_{t_0}^t \left | \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial \tau} \right | d\tau $$So to find the unit-speed parametarization we would *just* need to find $s^{-1}(t)$. But outside of textbooks where this would be a simple matter of basic calculus, finding a closed-form for a random curve is rarely as easy as we will see below. 

For our aformentioned example curve we can try to reparametarize the curve analytically using Mathematica (refer to [this](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/8454/generating-evenly-spaced-points-on-a-curve) SE thread for more details).

As mentioned, we have the following parametarization:
```mathematica
r[t_] = {t Cos[2^t], t Sin[2^t], 2^(t - 1)}
```

We'll use `Interpolation` which given a set of points, constructs an interpolation functions. Obviously, this won't necessarily give us accurate results - especially if we only evaluate the function at a few points
```mathematica
arcparam[n_] = 
 Interpolation[
  Table[{ArcLength[r[t], {t, 0, s}], r[s][[n]]}, {s, 0, 6 Pi, 0.2}]]
```
So this will tell us how $r(t)$ progresses as the arc-length increases (note that it is only evaluated at one parameter at a time). Now we have everything needed to find the arc-length parametarization (or more accurately, an analytical approximation)

```mathematica
rsaux := (arcparam[#] & /@ Range[3])
rs[s_] := {rsaux[[1]][s], rsaux[[2]][s], rsaux[[3]][s]} & @ s
```

Now we'll demonstrate that if we can find (almost) equidistant points on the curve indicating that the above is indeed an approximation of the arc-length parametarization.

Indeed we see that generating a few points gives us the following plot

Here it becomes even more obvious that since we haven't really found the closed form, the efficiency of our approximation depends on our step of our integration factor (here hard-coded at $10$) and of course the curve itself. However, we still can clearly ovserve that the calculated points lie near the intended curve and given more computationa resources and perhaps a more optimized way for calculating the interpolation function, we could have actually useful results.

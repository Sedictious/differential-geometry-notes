## Welcome

Welcome to my Differential Geometry notes! 

First disclaimer to get it out of the way, I am not an expert on the field and the sole scope of this is to provide interactive visualizations in order to aid intuition a bit and to "trim the fat". This is not an extensive nor a rigorous resource and shall not be treated as such - it should be just enough for someone that wants to get a very rough overview. I also apologize in advance for any possible inaccuracies or inconsistencies within the text - especially those stemming from improper proofreading. Feel free to let me know of any such mistakes however minor or major :)

Also there is a plan to replace all the hand-drawn "sketches" (even that is putting it charitably) with proper Tikz figures but I'm far from proficient at Tikz so I've been putting that off.

For a formal treatment, any of the well-established introductory texts (like do Carmo, O' Neill or Pressley) will offer a much more in-depth view. [Dr. Shifrin's](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/ShifrinDiffGeo.pdf) online notes are also cover most introductory topics and are freely available online. Also towards the end of preparing my own notes, I discovered [Jay Havaldar's](https://jhavaldar.github.io/notes_index) online notes which I'd also reommend to check out. As complementary reading, Needham's recent book "Visual Differential Geometry" is also an excellent approach and equally (if not more) exciting as his previous work - "Visual Complex Analysis".

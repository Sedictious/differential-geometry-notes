#### *A change of perspective*

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Properties

We start by a section that could easily be included at the beginning of our introduction to surfaces - that about the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry but it's really necessary to bring up now before we start exploring the concept of surface isometries.

Imagine you land on a huge alien planet. When walking on the surface you see the hills and valleys because you can see if you are ascending, descending or on a local extremum. So part-by-part, you can characterize the whole area and identify all the mountainous areas. Likewise, given two points on the surface you can find the shortest path connecting the two (we will call this geodesics). In short, you can have the wonders of the First Fundamental Form in your arsenal and you thus become able to calculate distance and areas. Those are called **intrinsic** properties.

However, your viewpoint is restricted to what's on the surface. You can't possible deduce how the planet you are on would look like to an alien titan (what would the "world" coordinates of each point be?). Those are called **extrinsic** properties. 

When the alien titan moves, bends and twists the surface without stretching or twisting it, the extrinsic geometry changes but you can't possibly detect any difference (granted that an alien titan can pass unnoticed).

### Definition

A local isometry $f$ between two surfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$ is a mapping that preserves the first fundamental form between the two surfaces.

Then for two vectors $v, u$ in the tangent plane of $S_1$ at point $P$. Let $\tilde f_P\left<v, u\right> = \left<D_P f(v),\ D_P f(u) \right>$

Let us choose a curve $\gamma$ of $S_1$. Then $f(\gamma$) belongs in $S_2$. But then the length of $\gamma$ will be 


$$\int \left<\dot{\gamma}, \dot{\gamma} \right>^{1/2} = 
\int \left<D_P f(\dot{\gamma}), D_P f(\dot{\gamma}) \right>^{1/2} = \int \tilde{f}_P  \left<\dot{\gamma}, \dot{\gamma} \right>^{1/2}$$
which means that the isometry also preserves curve length 

#### Example: Cylinder

We will prove that the plane is isometric to the cylinder. Of course we can easily see that one possible smooth mapping between those two surfaces is

$$f(u, v) = (\text{Cos}(u), \text{Sin}(u), v),\ u \in [0, 2\pi),\ v \in [0, 1)$$
```mathematica
Show[
 ParametricPlot3D[s[u, v], {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, 1}, 
  PlotRange -> {{-Pi, Pi}, {-1, 1}, {-0.5, 1}},
  ColorFunctionScaling -> False, 
  ColorFunction -> 
   Function[{x, y, z, u1, u2}, 
    ColorData["SolarColors"][Rescale[u1, {0, 2 Pi}, {0, 1}]]]],
 ParametricPlot3D[s1[u, v], {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, 1}, 
  ColorFunctionScaling -> False, 
  ColorFunction -> 
   Function[{x, y, z, u1, u2}, 
    ColorData["SolarColors"][Rescale[u1, {0, 2 Pi}, {0, 1}]]]]
 ]

```

Consider the curve $\gamma(t) = (2\pi t, t)$, taking the First Fundamental Form of the Cylinder

```mathematica
s[u_, v_] := {Cos[u], Sin[u], v}
ResourceFunction["FirstFundamentalFormCoefficients"][s[u, v], {u, v}]
```
$$\{1, 0, 1\}$$
Then calculating the length of the curve on the cylinder according to the previous chapter we get:

$$\int_0^1\sqrt{4\pi^2+1}d\tau = \sqrt{4\pi^2+1}$$

which we can easily verify by the Pythagoras' Theorem is the same length for the curve on the plane, thus the two have the same length as seen above.

### Connection to First Fundamental Form

Since we saw that two surfaces must be isometric through the length of the equivalent curve of each surface. It should follow, that we should be able to give a definition of symmetric surfaces through the First Fundamental Form. Indeed, two surfaces are isometric iff their First Fundamental Forms of the surface patches are **equal**. 

We can easily prove this through our existing definition.

If the two First Fundamental Forms are equal then the statement of the definition follows immediately:
$$\int \left<\dot{\gamma}, \dot{\gamma} \right>^{1/2} = 
\int \left<D_P f(\dot{\gamma}), D_P f(\dot{\gamma}) \right>^{1/2} = \int \tilde{f}_P  \left<\dot{\gamma}, \dot{\gamma} \right>^{1/2}$$

Conversely if

$$\int \left<\dot{\gamma}, \dot{\gamma} \right>^{1/2} = 
\int \tilde{f}_P  \left<\dot{\gamma}, \dot{\gamma} \right>^{1/2}$$
then it again follows that the two forms are equivalent.

#### Example 2

We'll examine a slightly more fancy example, the isometry between the helicoid

$$(u\ \text{Cos}(v), u\ \text{Sin}(v), v)$$
and a catenoid

$$(\text{Cosh}(u)\ \text{Cos}(v), \text{Cosh}(u) \ \text{Sin}(v), u)$$
Taking both fundamental forms

```mathematica
s1[u_, v_] := {Cosh[u] Cos[v], Cosh[u] Sin[v], u}
s2[u_, v_] := {u Cos[v], u Sin[v], v}
```

We can define $f(x, y) = (\text{Sinh}(x), y)$. So we can calculate:

```mathematica
ResourceFunction["FirstFundamentalFormCoefficients"][s1[u, v], {u, v}]
ResourceFunction["FirstFundamentalFormCoefficients"][
 s2[Sinh[u], v], {u, v}]
```

where we can see the two are identical!

Visualizing this

```mathematica
frame[t_] := Show[
  ParametricPlot3D[
   Cos[t] s1[u, v] + Sin[t] s2[u, v], {u, -Pi/2, Pi/2}, {v, -Pi, Pi}, 
   PlotPoints -> 40, PlotRange -> {{-Pi, Pi}, {-Pi, Pi}, {-Pi, Pi}}, 
   ColorFunctionScaling -> False, 
   ColorFunction -> 
    Function[{x, y, z, u1, u2}, 
     ColorData["BlueGreenYellow"][Rescale[u2, {-Pi, Pi}, {0, 1}]]]
   ]]
```

#### *Not this guy again*

Like we discussed in [[1.3 Curvature]], the curvature of a curve $\gamma$ is given by $\kappa = \ddot{\gamma}$. On a surface $S$, we can analyse it into its component perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface $\kappa_n$ (**normal curvature**) and a parallel component $\kappa_g$(**geodesic curvature**).

Something that we can infer immediately from trig:

$$\kappa_n = \kappa\ \text{Cos}(\theta)$$
$$\kappa_g = \kappa\ \text{Sin}(\theta)$$

Imagine now being on top of a point in a surface at looking at an angle $\phi$ (the angle can be measured from an arbitrary direction - specifics don't matter **for now**). Say the tangent vector that is the "direction" we are looking at is $\boldsymbol{w} = \alpha \boldsymbol{\sigma}_u + \beta \boldsymbol{\sigma}_v$. 

We consider $\kappa_n(\phi)$ to be the normal curvature of the curve at the direction $\boldsymbol{w}(\phi) = \alpha(\phi)\boldsymbol{\sigma}_u + \beta(\phi)\boldsymbol{\sigma}_v$. We also define $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ to be the biggest and smallest (signed) curvature values that $\kappa_{n_P}$  ($\kappa_{n_P}$ indicates that we are always talking about a specific point $P$). Those are called the **principal curvatures** and the subsequent tangents are the **principal directions**.

### Shape Operator and Fundamental Forms

Recall the matrix representation of the differential forms:
$$M_{I_P} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
E & F \\
F & G
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$M_{II_P} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
L & M \\
M & N
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Also, we've seen in [[2.6 Second Fundamental Form]] that:

$$\mathcal{W}_P(\sigma_u) = -N_u = a_1\ \sigma_u + \beta_1 \ \sigma_v$$
$$\mathcal{W}_P(\sigma_v) = -N_v = a_2\ \sigma_u + \beta_2\ \sigma_v$$
If we represent $\mathcal{W}$ in terms of the basis $\{\sigma_u,\ \sigma_v\}$ then its matrix representation $M_{\mathcal{W}_P}$ will be

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_1 & \alpha_2 \\
\beta_1 & \beta_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

But then we have 
$$L = -N_u\cdot\sigma_u=\left<\alpha_1\ \sigma_u +\beta_1\ \sigma_v,\ \sigma_u \right>_P= $$
$$\left<\{E\ \alpha_1\  +F\ \beta_1 ,\ F\ \alpha_2\ +G\ \beta_2 \},\ \{1, 0\}\right> = E\ \alpha_1 + F \beta_1$$
Similarly:

$$M = E\ \alpha_2  + F\ \beta_2 = F\ \alpha_1  + G\ \beta_1$$
$$N = F\ \alpha_2  + G\ \beta_2$$
But then we have

$$M_{II_P} = M_{I_P}M_{\mathcal{W}_P}$$
$$M_{\mathcal{W}_P} = M_{I_P}^{-1}M_{II_P}$$
So we have a matrix represnetation of the Weingarden Map/Shape Operator in terms of the fundamental forms! Also we have to keep in mind that we are always operating in the basis of $\{\sigma_u,\ \sigma_v\}$ 


```mathematica
ShapeOperator[s_] := {
  ff := ResourceFunction["FirstFundamentalFormCoefficients"][
    s[u, v], {u, v}];
  sf := ResourceFunction["SecondFundamentalFormCoefficients"][
    s[u, v], {u, v}];
  Inverse[{{ff[[1]], ff[[2]]/2}, {ff[[2]]/2, ff[[3]]}}] . {{sf[[1]], 
     sf[[2]]/2}, {sf[[2]]/2, sf[[3]]}}
  }
```

### Principal curvatures

The principal curvatures $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ we discussed above are in fact the **eigenvalues** of the shape operator matrix and the corresponding principal directions are its **eigenvectors**. In case you are interested, you can see a proof for this [here](https://web.mit.edu/hyperbook/Patrikalakis-Maekawa-Cho/node30.html). 

Remember now that $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{W}_P}$ is symmetrical, meaning that its eigenvectors (hence the principal directions) are **orthogonal** -  or in other words perpendicular to each other - if $\kappa_1 \neq \kappa_2$. If $\kappa_1 = \kappa_2$ this implies that $\kappa(\phi)$ is constant at $P$ and the point $P$ is called **umbilic**.

```mathematica
frame [u0_] :=
 {
  u1 := Eigenvectors[ShapeOperator[s]][[1]] /. {u -> u0, v -> 0};
  u1 = s @@ (ut u1/u1[[1]] + {u0, 0});
  u2 := Eigenvectors[ShapeOperator[s]][[2]] /. {u -> u0, v -> 0};
  u2 = s @@ (ut  u2/u2[[1]] + {u0, 0});
  
  Show[
   ParametricPlot3D[s[u, v], {u, -2, 2}, {v, -2, 2}, 
    PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}],
   ParametricPlot3D[{ u1, u2 }, {ut, -2, 2}, PlotStyle -> {Red}],
   Graphics3D[{Hue[0.5], Sphere[s[u0, 0], 0.1], PlotPoints -> 50}]
   }
```

We can easily convince ourselves that the two principal directions are orthogonal to each other - and if our eyes don't convince us then Mathematica easily can. Also he principal curvatures indeed take the highest and lowest curvature values at that point. If you have the means, I'd suggest running this example locally to also be able to play around with the prespective.

### Gaussian Curvature

We are finally able to define the **Gaussian curvature** as $\mathcal{K} = \kappa_1 \kappa_2$. From linear algebra, we know that the product of the eigenvalues of a matrix is its determinant which means $\mathcal{K} = \text{det}(M_{\mathcal{W}_P})$ 

```mathematica
s[u_, v_] := {u, v, u ^2 - v^2}
gausscurve := Det[ShapeOperator[s][[1]]]

plots = ParametricPlot3D[{u, v, gausscurve}, {u, -2, 2}, {v, -2, 2 }, PlotRange -> Full]

range = Last[PlotRange /. AbsoluteOptions[plots, PlotRange]]

ParametricPlot3D[s[u, v], {u, -1, 1}, {v, -1, 1}, 
 ColorFunctionScaling -> False,
 ColorFunction -> 
  Function[{x, y, u0, v0}, 
   ColorData["TemperatureMap"][
    Rescale[gausscurve /. {u -> u0, v -> v0}, range]]]]
```

![[saddle_gaussian.png]]

We see that in the "middle point" of the saddle one of the principal curvatures will be positive and another will be negative creating the recognizable saddle shape, hence the Gaussian curvature will be negative since $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ have opposite signs. Away from the middle the Gaussian curvature is positive since thhe two principal curvatures have the same sign. If the Gaussian curvature is zero, it doesn't mean tha the surface it necessarily flat, it just means that it has one "flat direction"

Summing everything up, we can discern the following classes for the Gaussian curvature $\mathcal{K}$ at point $P$:

* If $\mathcal{K} > 0$ then point $P$ is called **elliptic**
* If $\mathcal{K} < 0$ then point $P$ is called **hyperbolic** or **saddle point**
* If $\mathcal{K} = 0$ and $\kappa_1 \neq \kappa_2$ then $P$ is called **parabolic**
* If $\kappa_1 = \kappa_2 = 0$ then $P$ is called **planar**

Another really common example is also the torus. In the inside it resembles a parabola but on the outside an ellipse and hence the colouring we see here.

```mathematica
s[u_, v_] := {(2 + Cos[v]) Cos[u], (2 + Cos[v]) Sin[u], Sin[v]};
gausscurve = Det[ShapeOperator[s][[1]]]

plots = ParametricPlot3D[{u, v, gausscurve}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, 
   2 Pi}, PlotRange -> Full]
range = Last[PlotRange /. AbsoluteOptions[plots, PlotRange]]

ParametricPlot3D[s[v, u], {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, 2 Pi}, 
 ColorFunctionScaling -> False, 
 ColorFunction -> 
  Function[{x, y, u0, v0}, 
   ColorData["TemperatureMap"][
    Rescale[gausscurve /. {u -> u0, v -> v0}, range]]]]
```

### Theorem Egregium

We can't talk about Gaussian Curvature without mentioning the Gauss' ***Remarkable Theorem***. It states that the Gaussian curvature is invariant under local isometry and can thus be determined in its entirety by the First Fundamental Form of a surface. As seen in [[2.5 Isometries]], we can say that the Gaussian Curvature is part of the *extrinsic geometry* of the surface.

Imagine now bending a sheet of paper, since the Gaussian Curvature of a flat surface is zero for all points then we know that at least one of its principal curves must be 0. We can also see why we can't have a cartographic projection that preserves all distances (this would imply the existence of an isometry between surfaces of different Gaussian curvatures)

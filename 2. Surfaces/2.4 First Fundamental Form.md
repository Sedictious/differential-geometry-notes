#### *How to teach tiny people to measure distance*


### Definition

We are starting to get into the meat and bones of differential geometry.

We start by wanting to calculate distance on top of a surface. For a curve, we can employ our calculus. We know that the length of a curve is found by taking infinitesmal line segments  $\int_{[0, 1)} \rvert\lvert \dot \sigma (t) \rvert\lvert dt$.

![[curve_length.png]]

But when we are dealing with surfaces, we need to define the length in terms of the partial derivatives $\sigma_u$ and $\sigma_v$ . Extending the notion of the length of the curve, we won't be dealing with the surface itself but with the tangent plane on the point $P$. 

Any movement on the surface near the point $P$ can be expressed in terms of the partial derivatives according to $u$ and $v$. We need to define a map that defines a transormation of the tangent plane $T_PS$. We are interested in finding how $\sigma_u$ and $\sigma_v$ are "transformed" when moving to the surface.

We can find that $d \tilde{\sigma} ^2 = (d \tilde u + d \tilde{v}\ cos\omega)^2 + (d\tilde{v}\ sin\omega)^2$. Considering the scaling factor of the coordinate system $d \tilde{u} = A du$, $d \tilde{v} = B dv$  which leads us to our fundamental form:

$$A^2 du^2 + 2AB du\ dv\ cos\omega + B^2dv^2\ cos^2 \omega + B^2dv^2 sin^2\omega = $$

$$A^2du^2 + 2AB\ cos\omega\ du\ dv\ + B^2 dv^2 $$
$\omega$ is the angle between $du$ and $dv$.

Usually, this is expressed as:

$$Edu^2 + 2F du\ dv\ + G dv^2 $$
The first fundamental form defined for two tangent vectors at point $P$ of a surface $S$ $\boldsymbol{x}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{x}_2$:
$$\left<\boldsymbol{x}_1, \boldsymbol{x}_2 \right>_P = I_P(\boldsymbol{x}_1, \boldsymbol{x}_2) = \boldsymbol{x}_1^T 
\begin{bmatrix}
E & F \\
F & G
\end{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{x}_2
$$

$A$ and $B$ are the scaling of $du$ and $dv$ respectively. $2AB\ cos{\omega}$ represents the "shear" factor. We can see that if $du$ and $dv$ are orthogonal and thus $\omega = \pi/2$, then $cos{\omega} = 0$ and thus we can simplify the expression as 

$$Edu^2 + G dv^2 $$
The First Fundamental Form $\left<\ \right>_P$ is a **bilinear** form which simply means that is a linear form when considering each of its arguments separately.

#### Example: Sphere

We just with the most basic example, a sphere!

```mathematica
s[u_, v_] = {Sin[u] Cos[v], Sin[u] Sin[v], Cos[u]}
ParametricPlot3D[s[u, v], {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}]
```

![[simple_sphere.png]]

```mathematica
ResourceFunction["FirstFundamentalFormCoefficients"][s[u, v], {u, v}]
```

Where we find

$$\{1, 0, \text{Sin}[u]^2\}$$
we see that $du$ and $dv$ are orthogonal - which means that the $u$- and $v$-curves which are defined for taking curves on the surface with $u$ and $v$ respectively (also shown in the outline of the figure above) to be constant are orthogonal to each other at point $P$ (in this case this is true for all points of the sphere). 

The "scale factor" of the $u$ curves is constant Indeed it is shown that all u curves remain the same regardless of the fixed $v$. On the other hand, the $v$ curves vary with respect to $u$: Near the top, where $u\rightarrow 0$, $G$ is also zero as it is again visible from the curve. Near the equator, the $v$-curves start approximaing the $u$-curves - circles of radius $r=1$.

#### Example: Julia's Heart Surface

```mathematica
r[u_, v_] := {Sin[v] (15 Sin[u] - 4 Sin[3 u]), 8 Cos[v], 
 Sin[v] (15 Cos[u] - 5 Cos[2 u] - 2 Cos[3 u] - Cos[2 u])}
 ParametricPlot3D[r[u, v], {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}]
```

![[julias_heart.png]]

Taking 

```mathematica
ResourceFunction["FirstFundamentalFormCoefficients"][r[u, v], {u, v}]
```
gives a big formula of trig functions which can't be really analyzed by hand. Therefore we again resort to visual methods. First, we will visualize $E$, which as we again recall, is the scale factor of $du$ 

```mathematica
D[r[u, v], u] . D[r[u, v], u]
```

```mathematica
minsE := First[NMinimize[%4, {u, v}]] 
maxsE := First[NMaximize[%4, {u, v}]] 

ParametricPlot3D[r[ut, vt], {ut, 0, 2 Pi}, {vt, 0, Pi}, 
 ColorFunctionScaling -> False, 
 ColorFunction -> 
  Function[{x, y, z, u1, u2}, 
   ColorData["Rainbow"][
    Rescale[%4 /. {u -> u1, v -> u2}, {minsE, maxsE}, {0, 1}]]]]
```

![[julias_heart_E_plot.png]]
Doing the same thing for $dv$
```mathematica
D[r[u, v], v] . D[r[u, v], v]
```

```mathematica
minsE := First[FindMinimum[%7, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}]]
maxsE := First[FindMaximum[%7, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}]]
```

```mathematica
ParametricPlot3D[r[ut, vt], {ut, 0, 2 Pi}, {vt, 0, Pi}, 
 ColorFunctionScaling -> False, 
 ColorFunction -> 
  Function[{x, y, z, u1, u2}, 
   ColorData["Rainbow"][
    Rescale[%7 /. {u -> u1, v -> u2}, {minsE, maxsE}, {0, 1}]]]]
```
![[julias_heart_G_plot.png]]

There's no more to explain compared to the sphere is that the goemetry is here slightly more complex and there are now just two axes of symmetry. Howeever we still operate with $u$- and $v-$ curves and observe that whenever the curve gets "steeper" the value value becomes smaller (blue hue). 

We just do a single calculation for $F$ to examine the "orthogonality" of the two curve families:

```mathematica
D[r[u, v], v] . D[r[u, v], u]
```

```mathematica
minsF := First[FindMinimum[%10, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}]]
maxsF := First[FindMaximum[%10, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}]]
```

```mathematica
ParametricPlot3D[r[ut, vt], {ut, 0, 2 Pi}, {vt, 0, Pi}, 
 ColorFunctionScaling -> False, PlotPoints -> 100, 
 ColorFunction -> 
  Function[{x, y, z, u1, u2}, 
   ColorData["Rainbow"][
    Rescale[%10 /. {u -> u1, v -> u2}, {minsF, maxsF}, {0, 1}]]]]
```

Note that it is symmetrical on on the y axis with respect to the magnitude, the sign is just flipped

### Measuring Length and Areas

Up until now, the utility of the First Fundamental Form might not have been made entirely clear, but what we've done is basically succeeded into translating from an arbitrary surface into its tangent plane allowing to define a way to measure length of a curve on the surface.

Coming back into the definition of the First Fundamental Form, we found out that

$$Edu^2 + 2F du\ dv\ + G dv^2 = d\tilde\sigma^2$$
where $d\sigma$ is the infinitesmal length of a curve on the surface at a point $P$, meaning we can define the length of a curve $\gamma_S(t):[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\cap S$ on the surface $S$ to be:

$$\int_a^b (Edu^2 + 2Fdudv + Gdv^2)^{1/2} d\tau$$

Similarly, we can define the area of a surface patch but to do this we have to go back to the drawing board. We want to measure the area sketched by the parallelogram defined by $du$ and $dv$  which from elementary linear algebra we know is given by the magnitude of the vector $d\tilde{u}\times d\tilde{v}$. 

If we actually carry through the operation, $d\tilde{u}\times d\tilde{v}$ can be found to be $\sqrt{EG - F^2}$ where $EG - F^2$ is actually the determinant of the First Fundamental Form matrix and thus can be directly calculated from it!

![[first_fundamental_form_area.png]]
So putting it all together. to calculate the area of a surface patch we have

$$\int_{\mu_0}^{\mu_1}\int_{\nu_0}^{\nu_1} \sqrt{EG - F^2} d\nu d\mu$$
To verify this, we try to apply the above formula to the sphere whose fundamental form we calculated above:

$$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\text{sin}(u)dudv$$
```mathematica
Integrate[Integrate[Sin[u], {u, 0, Pi}], {v, 0, 2 Pi}]
```
Which gives us $4\pi$ as expected!

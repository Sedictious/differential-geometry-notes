#### *How to teach tiny people to measure curvature*

We saw that the definition of the First Fundamental Form was motivated from measuring the length on a surface. Like we did with curves, the next logical step is to attempt to find a way to define and calculate curvature in a way that it is consistent with the definition of the embedded curves.

### Definition

Consider we have a curve $\gamma$ on a surface patch $\sigma$. We'll take a point of $\gamma$, $\sigma(u, v)$. We can take another point on the same curve that's close to it and given by $\sigma(u + \Delta u, v + \Delta v),\Delta u \ll 1, \Delta v \ll 1$
![[second_form1.png]].

We can take the normal of the surface patch, $N$. If a surface is flat near the point $\sigma(u, v)$ then there's a region where for any point $\sigma(u + \Delta u, v+ \Delta v)$, the vector $\sigma(u + \Delta u, v+ \Delta v) - \sigma(u, v)$ is perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{N}$ - meaning that their dot product will be zero.

Conversely, the more the surface "curves" near $\sigma(u, v)$, the bigger the resulting dot product will be (remember that $\text{Cos}(\theta) = \left<\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v} \right>$). Let's try to calculate $\sigma(u + \Delta u, v+ \Delta v) - \sigma(u, v)$. From Taylor's theorem we get:

$$\sigma(u + \Delta u, v+ \Delta v) - \sigma(u, v) = \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial u}\Delta u + \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial v}\Delta v + \frac{1}{2} (\frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial u^2}(\Delta u)^2 + 2\frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial u v}\Delta u v + \frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial v^2}(\Delta v)^2) + O(u^3)$$
Getting rid of the zero terms and the higher-order terms we are left with

$$\frac{1}{2} (\frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial u^2}(\Delta u)^2 + 2\frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial u v}\Delta u v + \frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial v^2}(\Delta v)^2)$$
Now getting the dot product between this vector and $\boldsymbol{N}$ we get:

$$
\frac{1}{2} (\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial u^2}\cdot \boldsymbol{N}}_{\displaystyle L}\ (\Delta u)^2 + 2\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial u v}\cdot N}_{\displaystyle M}\ \Delta u v + \underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial v^2}\cdot \boldsymbol N}_{\displaystyle N}\ (\Delta v)^2)$$

Similarly to what we did in [[2.4 First Fundamental Form]], we define the **Second
Fundamental Form** for two tangent vectors at point $P$ of the surface, $\boldsymbol{x}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{x}_2$:
$$\left<\left<\boldsymbol{x}_1, \boldsymbol{x}_2 \right>\right>_P = II_P(\boldsymbol{x}_1, \boldsymbol{x}_2) = \boldsymbol{x}_1^T 
\begin{bmatrix}
L & M \\
M & N
\end{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{x}_2
$$
This definition may seem a bit forced and lacking in intuition but we will shortly see how incredible of a tool this is. We'll first do this by arriving at the same conclusion from a different starting point that will help to reinforce this statement.

### Gauss Map

In the previous definition we started by considering curves on a surface passing from a point $P$ and seeing how their angle to the normal varies. But why not get rid of the curve middleman and derive something just by considering the rate of change of the normal to the surface? If the normal changes rapidly then the rate of change will be big. Otherwise if the surface is flat, we know it will be zero since the normal will be the same for each point. Note that we will be talking about **oriented** surfaces.

We define the **Gauss Map** to map any point on the surface to its unit normal which can be thought as a vector on the **unit sphere**.

$$\mathcal{G}: T_PS\rightarrow T_{N(P)}S^2$$
We can visualize this as a map from a path on a surface to the mapping on the unit sphere. However, we'll try to achieve the same thing by *domain colouring*.

For now, we just try to treat the sphere as a color solid, defining an injection from the color domain to the sphere so in this way, we'll be able to map each normal of the unit sphere to a unique colour based on their azimuthian and elevation angles.

```mathematica
Normal2Color[u_, v_] := {
  a := ToSphericalCoordinates[Normalize[Normal[s[u, v]]]];
  Hue[ (a[[3]] + Pi) /(2 Pi), a[[2]] /Pi, Sqrt[a[[2]] /Pi]]
  }
ParametricPlot3D[{Sin[u] Cos[v], Sin[u] Sin[v], Cos[u]}, {u, 
  0, \[Pi]}, {v, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, 
 ColorFunction -> ((Normal2Color[#4, #5]) &), PlotPoints -> 100, 
 ColorFunctionScaling -> False, Mesh -> None]
 ```
![[domain_coloring_sphere.png]]

The results are certainly not the prettiest and the main problem with this specific domain coloring function is that the colouring is not uniform so it's hard to discern what the normal is just by observing the colour but this should work for now.

We will try to do the same on the 3-D Gaussian.

```mathematica
s[u_, v_] := {u, v, -Exp[-u^2 - v^2]}
Normal2Color[u_, 
  v_] := {a := ToSphericalCoordinates[Normalize[Normal[s[u, v]]]];
  Hue[(a[[3]] + Pi)/(2 Pi), a[[2]]/Pi, Sqrt[a[[2]]/Pi]]}
ParametricPlot3D[s[u, v], {u, -2, 2}, {v, -2, 2 }, 
 ColorFunction -> ((Normal2Color[#4, #5]) &), PlotPoints -> 100, 
 ColorFunctionScaling -> False, Mesh -> None]
```

Which makes sense if we combine it with the colouring on the top of the unit sphere

### Weingarten Map

Remember that our initial motivation for defining the Gauss map is so that we could calculate its *derivative*. We define the **Weingarten Map** as the negative derivative of the normal of the surface on point $P$ (the negative sign is used just simplifies calculations a little bit later when we got to see its connection with the Fundamental Forms).

$$\mathcal{W}_P : T_PS \rightarrow T_PS,\ \mathcal{W}_P = -D_P\mathcal{G}$$
Then the Second Fundamental Form is defined as

$$\left<\left< \mathcal{W}_P(\boldsymbol{x}_1), \boldsymbol{x}_2 \right>\right>_P,\ \boldsymbol{x}_1, \boldsymbol{x}_2 \in T_PS$$
The two definitions are equivalent (the proof is numerical and based on expressing $\mathcal{W}$ as a function of the normal of  the surface) so we ended up in the same position without mentioning anything about curves of the surface!

Note that we can calculate
$$\mathcal{W}_P(\sigma_u) = -D_PG(\sigma_u) = -\frac{\partial }{\partial u}_{u = u_0}N(u,v_0) = -N_u$$

and similarly 
$$\mathcal{W}_P(\sigma_v) = -N_v$$

If we take a step back this result looks almost trivial. The Weingarten map tells us the rate of change of the normal at any *direction* from point $P$ (remember it takes tangent vectors as input). If we take the derivative of the surface patch with respect to $u$ we are going to get $N_u$ (the minus sign is again mostly a matter of convention). 



The Weingarten Map is also seen as  **Shape Operator** symbolised as $\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol{x})$ and will play an important role in the next section.

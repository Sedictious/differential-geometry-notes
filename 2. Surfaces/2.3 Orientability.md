### Vector space orientation

As a call-back to linear algebra, when considering the span of a basis we don't care about order of the vectors. In any way we express the vectors, they produce the exact same vector space and a permutation of the order of the basis vectors results in permutation of the coordinates.

However when considering the orientation of vector space, we are talking about **ordered** bases. We arbitrarly choose the ordered basis $\{e_1, e_2,e_3\}$ to have a **positive** orientation. 

Now we can define two equivalence classes of ordered basis that produce a vector space. One is the positive orientation (right-hand orientation) or negative (left-hand orientation). As we see, we choose by convention the ordered basis $\{e_1, e_2,e_3\}$ to be positively oriented. Now the question that arises is *how* those equivalence classes are defined. We would expect that if we shifted the basis so we would have $\{e_2, e_3,e_1\}$ the orientation would be preserved whereas if we permuted any pair of vectors the orientation would be flipped. More generally, we want to have a matrix that doesn't "flip" the vectors of the space (therefore the eigenvectors) - which means that all the eigenvalues of the change of basis matrix are positive or equivalently that the matrix is **positive definite**. A matrix that is not positive definite is called **negative definite** (it has at least one negative eigenvalue).

Another definition of a positive definite matrix states that if a matrix $M$ is positive definite then for any vector $x$, $\left<x, Mx\right> > 0$ or in another words, the angle between $x$ and its transformation throught $M$ are at an angle between $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and  $\frac{\pi}{2}$, so all the vectors are in the same quarterion in respect to the original basis. It's perhaps easier to see now why no "flipping" is allowed.

In this way we can define "positive" and "negative" orientation as equivalence classes. A positively oriented vector space is one whose basis has a positive determinant - or equivalently one that  can be expressed as the change of basis of $\{e_1, e_2,e_3\}$ through a definite positive matrix. Similarly, a negative positive matrix can be expressed as the change of basis of $\{e_1, e_2,e_3\}$ through a *negative* positive matrix.

### Orientable surface
Consider a surface with parametarization $\sigma(u, v)$. As we saw in [[2.2 Tangent Plane]] the normal of the surface is 

$$\boldsymbol{N} = \frac{\sigma_u \times \sigma_v}{||\sigma_u \times \sigma_v||}$$
Now consider a second parametarization of the surface $\tilde{\sigma}(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v})$. Since both $\{\sigma_u,\sigma_v\}$ and $\{\tilde{\sigma}_\tilde{u}, \tilde{\sigma}_\tilde{v}\}$ constitute a basis of the tangent plane, we can express the change of basis in terms of the Jacobian. So for $u = u (\tilde u, \tilde v), v = v (\tilde u, \tilde v),$ then the Jacobian $\frac{\partial (u, v)}{\partial (\tilde u, \tilde v)}$  gives the desired change of basis.

So for this, we can deduce that $\tilde \sigma$ and $\sigma$ have the same orientation iff the determinant of the given Jacobian is positive.

A surface is called **non-orientable** if there doesn't exist an atlas such as if $M$ is the map between any patches in the atlas, then $J(M) > 0$

### Non-orientability: A classical example

A Mobius strip is contructed by taking a strip, twisting it and "gluing" it back as can be seen below:
```mathematica
frame[t0_] :=
 Show[
  ParametricPlot3D[{(1 + v/2*Cos[u/2]) Cos[u], (1 + v/2*Cos[u/2]) Sin[
      u], v/2 Sin[u/2]}, {u, Max[0, t0 - 2 Pi], t0}, {v, -1, 1},
   PlotRange -> {{-1.5, 1.5}, {-1.5, 1.5}, {-1.5, 1.5}}, 
   Mesh -> {20, 20}, Axes -> False, Boxed -> False, 
   PlotStyle -> FaceForm[Red, Blue]]
  ]
```

If the surface was **orientable** then we would be able to define a continuous mapping of the normal $P\rightarrow N_P$. The normal is defined as we've seen in [[2.2 Tangent Plane]], $$P = \sigma(x, y),\ N_P = \sigma_x \times \sigma_y$$
Since we are looking at a continuous mapping, we assume we run over a line across the surface $n_\theta = N_{\sigma(c, \theta)}$. Then, we must be able to express the normal mapping as $N(\theta) = -N_\theta$ or $N(\theta) = N_\theta$ depending on the conventional orientation. But we see that there's no such continuous function at $n\rightarrow 2\pi k$ because the sign will be flipped at that point.

### Non-orientability: A more exotic example


```mathematica
frame[t0_] :=
 Show[
  ParametricPlot3D[{(1 + v/2*Cos[u/2]) Cos[u], (1 + v/2*Cos[u/2]) Sin[
      u], v/2 Sin[u/2]}, {u, Max[0, t0 - 2 Pi], t0}, {v, -1, 1},
   PlotRange -> {{-1.5, 1.5}, {-1.5, 1.5}, {-1.5, 1.5}}, 
   Mesh -> {20, 20}, Axes -> False, Boxed -> False, 
   PlotStyle -> FaceForm[Red, Blue]]
  ]
```

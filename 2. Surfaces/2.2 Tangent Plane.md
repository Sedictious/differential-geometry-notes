### Tangent Vectors and Derivatives

Let's start off with a pretty crucial definition:

> A **tangent space** $\boldsymbol{V}$ to $S$ at point $P \in S$  is defined as a set of vector set such as for all $v \in \boldsymbol{V}$, $<v, N> = 0$ where $N$ the normal of the surface at the point $P$. All members of $\boldsymbol{V}$ are called **tangent vectors**

### The Tangent Plane

Consider the Monge Patch of a surface:

> $\sigma(u,\ v) = (u,\ v,\ h(u, v)) :$

Then the **tangent plane** at point $P$ $T_P$  can be expressed as the vector space produced by its partial derivatives $\text{span}\left<\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial u}, \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial v} \right> = \text{span}\left < \sigma_u, \sigma_v \right >$.


```mathematica
r[u_, v_] := {u, v, u^3 - v^2}
grad = Grad[r[u, v], {u, v}]
Show[
 ParametricPlot3D[r[u, v], {u, -1, 1}, {v, -1, 1}, 
  PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}, {-2, 2}}],
 Graphics3D[{Arrowheads[0.03], 
   {
    Arrow[{r[t0, 0], 
      r[t0, 0] +  grad[[All, 1]] /. {u -> t0, v -> 0} }],
    Arrow[{r[t0, 0], r[t0, 0] +  grad[[All, 2]] /. {u -> t0, v -> 0} }]
    }
   }]
 ]
```

Also note that the **normal of the surface** is the normal of the respective tangent plane:

$$\boldsymbol{N} = \frac{\sigma_u \times \sigma_v}{||\sigma_u \times \sigma_v||}$$
### Parital derivative of surface

Before moving on the definition, let's come back to what our intuition tells us that a derivative is. Of course, like we did with curves, we know that a derivative represents the rate of change.  But whereas curves only dependent on one parameter (conventionally referred to as "time"), here we deal with two parameters so logically, we expect the derivative of the surface to be dependent on the two partial derivatives (aka we expect a linear map)

Since the tangent plane is the span of the two partial derivatives of a mapping $\sigma$, any tangent vector can be written as  $\lambda \sigma_u + \mu \sigma_v$.

Consider now a mapping between two surfaces $f: S\rightarrow W$. Calculating the derivative of $f$ we expect to find out how moving around $S$ "maps" into $W$. So we end up again calculate how the motion on $W$ changes which we expect to be expressed as a tangent vector but this time on $W$.

> Let us consider a map $f(u, v) \rightarrow (f_1(u, v), f_2(u,v))$, then the linear map $D_P f$ of the derivative of $f$ at point $P$ is 
> $$\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial v}\\
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial v}\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

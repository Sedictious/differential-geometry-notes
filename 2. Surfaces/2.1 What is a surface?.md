#### *Things are never what they seem to be*

### Definition 

We finally graduted from curves and are ready to tackle *surfaces*. Things get admittedly more hairy even when trying to define what a surface is intuitively. A point is definitely *not* a surface and a plane is. But beyond that we are often at a loss. Is a surface any set of points in 3D space? Must this set be compact? Connected? 

Fortunately we do have a formal definition:

> A **surface** is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$, $S$ such that for every point $P\in S$, there exist the **open** subset $V\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, $U\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ such that there is a differentiable homemorphism $f: V \rightarrow U \cap S$. 

> A **regular** surface shares the same definition with the difference being that we require $f$ to be 1-1.

This tells us that for an area around every point on the surface we can define a function that maps open sets from the plane to the surface - such a mapping is called a **surface patch** 

Since those patches are defined for every point in a surface, it follows that we can construct any surface from such patches. We call a collection that covers the whole surface $\{f_0, ..., f_n\}, f_i:V_i \rightarrow U_i \cap S, 0 \leq i \leq n$ such that $\bigcup_{i=0}^n\left(U_i \cap S\right) = S$ an **atlas**.

#### A classic example 
We will examine an example that is in most differential geometry textbooks around - finding the atlas of a sphere. We want to cover the sphere with open sets. 

Perhaps we can define one patch for the northern and one for the southern hemisphere  

```mathematica
Show[
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], 
   Sin[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], Cos[\[CurlyPhi]]}, {\[Theta], 
   0, \[Pi]}, {\[CurlyPhi], -\[Pi]/2, \[Pi]/2}, 
  PlotStyle -> {Orange}, 
  PlotRange -> {{-1.5, 1.5}, {-1.5, 1.5}, {-1.5, 1.5}}],
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]], Sin[\[Theta]], 
   0}, {\[Theta], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, PlotStyle -> {Black, Dashed, Thick}],
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], 
   Sin[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], Cos[\[CurlyPhi]]}, {\[Theta], 0, 
   2 \[Pi]}, {\[CurlyPhi], \[Pi]/2, \[Pi]}, PlotStyle -> {Cyan}]
 ]
 ```

but this isn't really an atlas of the sphere. Remember that the patches map **open** sets, so in this case the equator isn't covered. We can also add the east and west hemispheres but we will still missing two points $(0, 1, 0)$ and $(0, -1, 0)$ so we can construct an atlas with 6 patches as following (I didn't realize how haird the snippet got but I think it's still *fairly* readable):

```mathematica
Show[
 (*North Hemisphere*)
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], 
   Sin[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], Cos[\[CurlyPhi]]}, {\[Theta], 
   0, \[Pi]}, {\[CurlyPhi], -\[Pi]/2, \[Pi]/2}, 
  PlotStyle -> {Orange}, 
  PlotRange -> {{-2.5, 2.5}, {-2.5, 2.5}, {-2.5, 2.5}}],
 
 (*Equator*)
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]], Sin[\[Theta]], 
   0}, {\[Theta], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, PlotStyle -> {Black, Dashed, Thick}],
 
 (*South Hemisphere*)
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], 
   Sin[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], 
   Cos[\[CurlyPhi]]}, {\[Theta], -2 \[Pi], 
   0}, {\[CurlyPhi], \[Pi]/2, \[Pi]}, PlotStyle -> {Cyan}],
 
 (*Western Hemesphere*)
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], 
   Sin[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]] + 1, Cos[\[CurlyPhi]]}, {\[Theta], 
   0, \[Pi]}, {\[CurlyPhi], 0, \[Pi]}, 
  PlotStyle -> {Green, Opacity[0.6]}, 
  BoundaryStyle -> {Thick, Black, Dashed}],
  
  (*Eastern Hemesphere*)
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], 
   Sin[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]] - 1, Cos[\[CurlyPhi]]}, {\[Theta], 
   0, \[Pi]}, {\[CurlyPhi], -\[Pi], 0}, 
  PlotStyle -> {Yellow, Opacity[0.6]}, 
  BoundaryStyle -> {Thick, Black, Dashed}],
 
 (*"Back" Hemesphere*)
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]] - 1.5, 
   Sin[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], Cos[\[CurlyPhi]]}, {\[Theta], 
   3 \[Pi]/2, 5 \[Pi]/2}, {\[CurlyPhi], -\[Pi], 0}, 
  PlotStyle -> {Purple, Opacity[0.6]}],
 
 (*"Front" Hemesphere*) 
 ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]] + 1.5, 
   Sin[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], 
   Cos[\[CurlyPhi]]}, {\[Theta], \[Pi]/2, 
   3 \[Pi]/2}, {\[CurlyPhi], -\[Pi], 0}, 
  PlotStyle -> {Red, Opacity[0.6]}]
 ]
```

Ta-da! We finally found our atlas.

### Monge Patches

A **Monge patch** is a patch that's in the form of:

$\boldsymbol{f}(u,\ v) = (u,\ v,\ h(u, v)) :$

This is just a convenient way to express a surface and it will come into play a bit later. However, we can find an equivalent definition of a regular surface using Monge patches:

A **regular surface** is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$, $S$ such that for every point $P\in S$, there exist the **open** subset $V\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, $U\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ such that there is a differentiable homemorphism $f: V \rightarrow U \cap S$ such that $U\cap S$ can be expressed as a Monge patch.

The equivalence of this definition follows directly from the **Implicit Function Theorem** which in the 3D case states that:

> For a continuously differentiable $f:\mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$  at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ with $f(x_0, y_0, z_0) = c$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} (x_0, y_0, z_0) \neq 0$, there is a neighborhood around the point such that $f$ can be written as $f(x, y, z(x, y))$


### Critical and Regular Points

Before moving on, we have to briefly cover some prerequisites from Calculus.

#### Differential Mapping

> Let $f: U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a differentiable mapping ($U$ open). The differential map is defined as 

> $$Df(P) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \dots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\ 
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \dots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}\\
\end{bmatrix}$$


#### Inverse Function Theorem

> Let $f: U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ be a differentiable mapping ($U$ open). If $P \in U$ and $Df(P)$ and $f$ is inversible at a neighborhood around $P$. Then there exist a neighborhood $U_P \ni P$, $V_Q \ni Q = f(P)$ such that $f_{U_p} = F|_{U_p}: U_p \rightarrow V_q$ is bijective and its inverse $f^{-1}$ is differentiable. 

> Moreover: 
> $$Df_{U_p}^{-1}(q) = (Df(p))^{-1}$$
$$$$

For a differentiable mapping $f: U\subset \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ as it's domain:
* If at point $P\in U$, the differentiable map $Df(P)$ is not surjective, $f(p)$ is called a **critical point** of $f$
* A point $Q \in f(U)$ is called **regular value** if $\forall P \in f^{-1}(Q)$, $P$ is a  critical point
* If a point $Q \in f(U)$ is **not** a regular value, it is called a **critical value** 


Now we'll try to find out the critical point of a cone 
```mathematica
r[u_, v_] := {u Cos[v], u Sin[v], u}
ParametricPlot3D[r[u, v], {u, 0, 1}, {v, 0, 2 Pi}]
grad := Grad[r[u, v], {u, v}]
```

![[cone.png]]

But when running

```mathematica
MatrixRank[grad]
```

we get 2 (which implies the columns are linearly independent and thus surjectiveness is implied). But what happened here? We expected to find a critical point at $(0, 0, 0)$. Well, if we go back to the elementary definition of the derivative we find that it actually **not defined** and therefore we can't expect to derive any information from the Jacobian since it's not  defined at $(0, 0)$.
